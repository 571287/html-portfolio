<h3>Friends</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite web series and it's so realxing <br>
    I watched it many times.
</p>
<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>I love this series because of the suspense it creates and ofcourse the mind of professor.</p>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>I like it because of the queen dagarays and her dragons.<br>
    Otherwise, it's so vulnerable and political.
